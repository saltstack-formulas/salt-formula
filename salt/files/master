# This configuration file is used to manage the behavior of the Salt Master
# Values that are commented out but have no space after the comment are
# defaults that need not be set in the config. If there is a space after the

# Per default, the master will automatically include all config files
# from master.d/*.conf (master.d is a directory in the same directory
# as the main master config file)

# Max open files
# Each minion connecting to the master uses AT LEAST one file descriptor, the

#   Too many open files (tcp_listener.cpp:335)
#   Aborted (core dumped)
#
# By default this value will be the one of `ulimit -Hn`, ie, the hard limit for
# max open files.
#
# If you wish to set a different value than the default one, uncomment and
# configure this setting. Remember that this value CANNOT be higher than the
# hard limit. Raising the hard limit depends on your OS and/or distribution,
# a good way to find the limit is to search the internet for(for example):
#   raise max open files hard limit debian

#####      File Server settings      #####

# roots cannot match, otherwise the downloaded files will not be able to be
# reliably ensured. A base environment is required to house the top file.
# Example:
